# Log4j's 2021 vulnerability

In december 2021, a vulnerability on Log4j was found, so I created a simple slideshow with web
technologies explaining it. It has been designed so that non-programmers can still understand the thing.

Also, I was meant to present this orally so some details may be missing, details that was meant to be
said (rather than written).

## Overview

### Just reading

The slideshow is published to GitHub Pages so you can quickly
[open it](https://MartinHeywang.github.io/slideshow-log4j-vulnerability).

By the way, if you like the project, don't forget to share it with your friends and family :) !

### Inspect

If you are a developer, you may be interested in inspecting the project. Execute the following line in
your terminal:

```bash
# Clone the repo
gh repo clone MartinHeywang/slideshow-log4j-vulnerability

# Serve it on localhost
# optional: npm install serve --global
serve -s slideshow-log4j-vulnerability
```

## Neat details

I need to mention:

- This project does not use any (CSS / JS) framework,
- I made this totally from scratch.
